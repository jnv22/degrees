By employing Breadth-First Search, we can explore a CSV dataset from IMDB to determine the shortest path linking two actors through the films theyâ€™ve starred in together. For example, the fastest route between Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise consists of two links: Tom Hanks connects to Kevin Bacon through "Apollo 13," and Kevin Bacon connects to Tom Cruise via "A Few Good Men."

There are two collections of CSV data files provided: one in the large directory and the other in the small directory. While both sets feature files with the same names and structures, the small directory contains a much more compact dataset, making it more suitable for testing and experimentation. If you prefer to use the smaller dataset, please specify "small" as a command line argument.
